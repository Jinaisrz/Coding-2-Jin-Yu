# Openframework 1 - Boids

### Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgUVefU8bUI

This code implements two Boids classes where Boids have position, velocity and movement rules including separation, coalescence and alignment. Boids can interact with other Boids to calculate the direction of their movement by calculating the distance between them. This Boid class also has the ability to maintain boundaries to avoid Boids flying off the screen. In addition, the code includes a number of helper functions, such as setting and getting weights and thresholds.

# Openframework 2
### Video link: https://youtu.be/0-5rDZttEf0

This code is a video processing application based on the openFrameworks library that uses a computer camera to capture video and convert the pixels in the video frames into ASCII character graphics. The program uses some common openFrameworks functions and objects, such as ofVideoGrabber for capturing video, ofPixelsRef for getting pixel data and ofTrueTypeFont for drawing ASCII characters. The program also uses a number of openFrameworks functions to set the window size, set the background colour, resize characters, display video settings and so on. In addition, the program contains a number of mouse and keyboard event handler functions.
